# Whisper-python
A short experimentation with Whisper API to record and transcribe voice to text

1. Clone the repository

2. Start the application - it will ask for recording permission and once it starts, voice will be recorded until application is stopped.

3. Once you stop the application, it will generate a wav file in the project directory.

4. If you don't have it yet, generate API key. You can do that here: [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)

5. Uncomment get_voice function and comment record_voice function and start the application - it will display transcribed text in the console
